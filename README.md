# classification-challenge

## About

In this jupyter noteboook I am using Logistical Regression and Random Forest Classifier machine learning mdoels to accurately detect
whether an email can be marked as spam or not.  I am training the data and splitting it as well as scaling the data to 
make sure all values are on the same scale before fitting and predicting the moodel.  This also makes sure we are not leaking 
data into the model.  Once predictions are made, I am grabbing the accuracy score of the 2 models and making a determination on
which moodel performs better on this datta set.

## Key Features
- Sci-kit learn
- Logistical Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Standard Scaler
- Accuracy score
